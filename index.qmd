# Mission

Our mission is to accelerate the deployment of machines that can perceive, reason, and safely interact with the complexities of the physical world. We're building modular AI components and a developer platform that enables companies to build, integrate and control physical AI without starting from scratch.

Physical AI deployments will revolutionize information processing systems in two ways:

- Intelligent machinery will act as a force multiplier for human operators looking to manipulate the physical world
- Targeted data feeds produced by this machinery will allow existing digital systems to plan and coordinate more effectively

Imagine automated construction equipment that can fill in detailed soil composition maps as a dig proceeds, or patient monitoring systems aware that they are participating in a hospital-wide optimization process.

Current approaches treat physical AI as standalone automation rather than as extensions of digital infrastructure. The real opportunity lies in building physical AI with the explicit goal of participating in existing systemsâ€”not just automating isolated tasks, but serving as intelligent sensors that can execute specific functions while continuously reporting back both their intended outputs and the rich environmental data they gather as a byproduct.

# What we're building

Today's physical AI deployments fail because teams approach core systems like vision, localization, and decision-making independently, using ad-hoc solutions that are often brittle and generalize poorly. The resulting systems behave unpredictably and can't produce reliable data for ingestion into existing digital infrastructure.

We aim to solve this problem by building an AI platform for perception, reasoning and planning in physical systems. Our platform will provide domain specific AI modules operable via clean APIs and designed to integrate with existing software, models, agents, and commodity hardware. Our software runs on the GPU and handles the hard problems of sensor fusion and multi-input reasoning at the edge, so a users' physical systems can participate intelligently as peripherals of a larger system instead of operating as unreliable, unpredictable pieces of machinery.

> **Our goal is to do for physical AI what Cisco did for networking, or Stripe did for payment infrastructure.**

To achieve this, we will build:

- **Basic physical AI modules** for machine perception and localization
- **Coordination interfaces** that combine these modules into reliable composite systems
- **Data interfaces** for these modules, so that users can absorb valuable data back into their digital systems
- **Reliable "human override" abilities** for all modules, so that humans can intervene and resolve ambiguity
- **A developer platform** to handle logging, monitoring, aggregation and reporting at the interface between physical AI and digital systems

# How we're starting

We bring deep expertise in probabilistic modeling and inference-time compute, and we're translating that into real-world impact with obsessive focus on user problems and craftsmanship in every layer of the product.

We began by interviewing dozens of companies making bets on physical AI. Out of these, we're partnering with a small number of companies in different verticals building information processing systems with an important physical AI component. We'll work closely with each team to deploy their domain-specific physical automation, and to adapt their digital infrastructure to make effective use of the data generated by these intelligent systems.

Our first set of modules enable reliable perception in the real world by:

- **Accurately mapping the environment**, along with the agent itself
- **Fusing multiple sensor streams intelligently** (camera, LiDAR, radar, INS) in order to perceive robustly in difficult environments
- **Abstracting matter into percepts / objects** with semantic meaning (i.e. humans)
- **Data-efficiently recognizing and learning** the features of novel objects
- **Running reliably on edge hardware** with no network connection

# Why Us?

Our [team](team/index.qmd) combines deep expertise from both academia and industry.

At companies like **Twitter**, **Stripe** and **Google [x]**, we've scaled production information systems to support billions of users, pioneered machine learning infrastructure at scale, and built developer platforms used by some of the world's most sophisticated engineering organizations.

The explosion of neural net architectures and applications was built on a strong investment in compilers and programming languages (pytorch, tensorflow). Our team has similar PL and compiler expertise and is prepared to unlock a similar explosion for physical AI.

The techniques we're using are in the same family as the "inference-time compute" methods that are delivering excellent results for coordinating neural nets. Our team has spent years at MIT perfecting our ability to explore this space.
